# Aura machines

The whole point of pumping aura up, which is hard and takes work, is so it can fall down again, and do work for you. Functional nodes are what do the work.

## mechanics

Not all aura can do work (specifically, the item aura can't do work, since it can be created at any height with any item)

The amount of aura, as well as the angle of incidence (!) to the functional node, changes the amount of work it does.

* A lot of Aura Cascade's functions were based on randomness, like "changes nearby sheep to a random color", and i'm not a suuuuper huge fan of randomness for the sake of it.
* A lot of Botania's functions are configured by placing things under the flower, which is cool (in-world and adjustable with pistons and the like) but it would be cool to avoid that

#### I cooka da pizza

In-world smelting probably, idk? Given enough work it will cook some (randomly chosen, if ambiguous) items dropped nearby. Could be like a "vanilla furnace exciter" as well although that's a bit done to death these days

# Funny block placer machine

Not sure how best to do this

* Just a clone of the Rannuncarpus.
* If it has 100 item aura that's of a block, purifies the aura and place the block. The placement works as if you had a player whos head is in the aura node, looking away from the direction the aura comes in and right clicks i.e. it's raytraced out from the angle of incidence

# Shockwave

Noooo idea what this would do, but I like the idea of sending a whole ton of aura straight down at once causing some sort of shockwave.

* Loud sound
* Flings mobs (& players) up and away a bit
* Crumble blocks, like stone -> cobble etc

# Mob duplicator

No but like literally, a mob *duplicator*. Takes one mob, cuts its health by (at least) 1/2, and spawns another of the same mob at the same health.

So you can use it to farm up drops, or like, duplicate -> heal -> duplicate -> heal for an infinite mob spawner.
