# Aura crystals

Halogen is very much about flowing aura around in a loop, so where do you get the aura from in the first place? Well, aura crystals.

## Automation

Unlike a lot of other things in the mod, they do not interact with automation at all.

* You do not need to automatically create aura crystals.
	* You just need a set amount, to have some in the system, and that amount never goes up or down.
	* There's no point in hoarding aura itself.
* You cannot (automatically|losslessly) turn aura back into aura crystals.
	* If you could, you could move crystals up using item transfer technologies and dissolve them back into the system.
	* This lets you avoid using pumps to send it upwards, skipping half the mod.

## Obtaining

They *shouldn't* be something you craft, because if they're craftable, they're automatable.

Im thinking something like: You find a particular structure, and at midnight, the structure exchanges nearby amethyst shards for aura crystals under the moonlight.

* Want to be careful not to make it *too* expensive and hard to get started lmao like, well now the list of requirements is pretty long (amethyst (rare), midnight (need to reach it intentionally and not sleep), structure (possibly rare)). 
* The structure will look like a small, half-exposed geode; with a moonlight prism in the middle, and possibly some active amethyst buds surrounding it.
* Maybe modify the vanilla geodes to add a larger moonlight prism in the middle, which you can dig out and expose to moonlight to activate.

Roots got criticised a lot for having a midnight-based mechanic and it was eventually removed. Which I think is a shame! Some of my fondest memories of 1.11 modded minecraft are venturing out into the night and like, it was a *thing* I had to plan for.

With a hard mechanic like this though, it requires a lot of player buy-in so I should be careful not to let them down ;)
